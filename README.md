ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m RÃ©my Ruiz.

I'm a web dev full stack who's been there when there was no other framework than angular.js and then pivoted to vue.js.

It's been a while since I really coded for the web and in the meantime I added a strong security base knowledge to my belt and even got the eJPT.
I'm going back to web dev for the moment and I'm happy to see vue.js progess ever more and I will be playing with it in the near future.
